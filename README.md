A Tech Tree Parser / Displayer for Stellaris

Uses https://github.com/tboby/cwtools/tree/master/CWTools to parse a directory tree of stellaris folders to get all the research options and convert them and their dependencies to a json format that can be parsed by a graphing library.  

Currently using http://visjs.org for graphing.

Still very much in development.
